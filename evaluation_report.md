Restaurant Recommendation System Evaluation Report
1. Introduction
The Restaurant Recommendation System is a Streamlit-based web application designed to recommend restaurants based on user preferences for cuisine, budget, and location. Built using a Zomato dataset, the system incorporates A/B testing with two ranking strategies (Rating-heavy and Votes-heavy) and allows re-ranking of recommendations without resubmitting preferences. This report evaluates the system's performance, summarizes user feedback, and proposes improvements.
2. System Overview

Data Source: Zomato dataset (zomato.csv) with columns including Restaurant Name, City, Cuisines, Average Cost for two, Aggregate rating, Votes, Latitude, and Longitude.
Features:
Form-based input for cuisines, budget, location, and ranking strategy.
A/B testing with two strategies:
Strategy A (Rating-heavy): 80% weight on normalized rating, 20% on normalized votes.
Strategy B (Votes-heavy): 50% weight on normalized rating, 50% on normalized votes.


Re-ranking functionality to switch strategies without resubmitting preferences.
Persistent recommendations using session state.
Feedback form collecting satisfaction (1-5) and relevance (Yes/No).
Map visualization for restaurant locations.


Objective: Provide accurate, user-preferred restaurant recommendations and evaluate ranking strategies via A/B testing.

3. Evaluation Methodology
3.1 A/B Testing Setup

Strategies:
Strategy A: Prioritizes high ratings, potentially favoring quality over popularity.
Strategy B: Balances ratings and votes, favoring popular restaurants with more reviews.


Metrics:
Satisfaction Score: User rating (1-5) from the feedback form.
Relevance Rate: Percentage of users marking recommendations as relevant (Yes/No).
Recommendation Success Rate: Percentage of queries returning non-empty recommendations.


Process:
Users select preferences and a strategy via the preferences form.
Recommendations are displayed, with an option to re-rank using a different strategy.
Feedback is collected to compare strategies.



3.2 Data Collection

Feedback Mechanism: Users submit satisfaction and relevance via a separate feedback form after viewing recommendations.
Assumed Data: Since actual user feedback is unavailable, we simulate feedback based on typical user interactions (to be replaced with real data):
10 users tested Strategy A, 10 tested Strategy B.
Feedback collected for satisfaction and relevance after initial ranking and re-ranking.



4. Evaluation Results
4.1 A/B Testing Results
The following table summarizes the assumed performance of the two strategies (placeholder data):



Strategy
Avg. Satisfaction (1-5)
Relevance Rate (%)
Success Rate (%)



A: Rating-heavy
4.2
80%
85%


B: Votes-heavy
3.8
70%
90%



Strategy A:
Higher average satisfaction (4.2), likely due to prioritizing high-rated restaurants.
Slightly lower success rate (85%) as high ratings may be less common in some locations.
80% of users found recommendations relevant.


Strategy B:
Lower satisfaction (3.8), possibly because popular restaurants (high votes) may not always align with user quality expectations.
Higher success rate (90%) due to more restaurants having sufficient votes.
70% relevance rate, indicating slightly less alignment with user preferences.



4.2 Re-ranking Performance

Functionality: Users could re-rank recommendations by selecting a new strategy without resubmitting preferences, using the stored filtered dataset.
Results:
Re-ranking was successful in updating the recommendation order based on the new strategy.
Users reported (assumed) improved satisfaction when switching to Strategy A from B (e.g., from 3.8 to 4.0) due to better alignment with quality preferences.
No performance issues (e.g., delays) were noted during re-ranking.



4.3 System Robustness

Data Handling:
Successfully mapped dataset columns (Restaurant Name, City, Cuisines, etc.) to standard names.
Handled missing columns and non-numeric values (e.g., Average Cost for two) robustly.


Error Rate: No crashes reported after fixing the TypeError in cost processing.
Map Visualization: Displayed correctly when Latitude and Longitude were valid.

5. User Feedback
5.1 Feedback Collection

Mechanism: Feedback form with:
Satisfaction slider (1-5).
Relevance radio button (Yes/No).


Assumed Feedback (replace with actual data):
Strategy A:
Users appreciated high-quality recommendations but noted fewer options in less-populated areas.
Comments: "Great for finding top-rated places, but sometimes no results for small cities."


Strategy B:
Users liked the variety of popular restaurants but felt some recommendations were less relevant.
Comments: "Lots of options, but some places didn’t feel high-quality."


Re-ranking:
Users found re-ranking intuitive and valued the ability to compare strategies.
Comments: "Switching to Rating-heavy improved my results."





5.2 Feedback Analysis

Satisfaction: Strategy A outperformed Strategy B, suggesting users prioritize quality (ratings) over popularity (votes).
Relevance: Lower relevance for Strategy B indicates a need for better alignment with user preferences.
Usability: The form-based input, persistent recommendations, and separate feedback form were well-received.

6. Proposed Improvements
6.1 Dynamic Re-ranking

Issue: Current re-ranking requires a button click, which is acceptable but not dynamic.
Improvement: Implement on-the-fly re-ranking using Streamlit’s on_change callback for the strategy dropdown, updating recommendations instantly when the strategy changes.
Implementation:def on_strategy_change():
    if st.session_state.filtered_df is not None:
        recommendations = filter_and_rank_restaurants(
            st.session_state.filtered_df,
            st.session_state.preferences['cuisines'],
            st.session_state.preferences['budget'],
            st.session_state.preferences['location'],
            st.session_state.new_strategy
        )
        st.session_state.recommendations = recommendations
        st.session_state.preferences['strategy'] = st.session_state.new_strategy

new_strategy = st.selectbox(
    "Select New Strategy",
    ["A: Rating-heavy", "B: Votes-heavy"],
    index=0 if preferences['strategy'] == "A: Rating-heavy" else 1,
    key="new_strategy",
    on_change=on_strategy_change
)



6.2 Enhanced Filtering

Issue: Some queries return no results due to strict filtering (e.g., specific locations or cuisines).
Improvement:
Add partial matching for cuisines (e.g., match "Indian" in "North Indian, South Indian").
Introduce a "nearby locations" filter using Latitude and Longitude to include restaurants in adjacent areas.
Allow users to relax filters (e.g., ignore budget if no matches).



6.3 Additional Ranking Strategies

Issue: Only two strategies limit A/B testing scope.
Improvement:
Add a third strategy, e.g., Cuisine-match-heavy, prioritizing restaurants with exact cuisine matches.
Example:if strategy == "C: Cuisine-match-heavy":
    filtered_df['cuisine_score'] = filtered_df['cuisines'].apply(
        lambda x: sum(c.lower() in x.lower() for c in cuisines) / len(cuisines)
    )
    filtered_df['score'] = (filtered_df['normalized_rating'] * 0.5) + \
                         (filtered_df['votes'].apply(lambda x: min(x, 1000) / 1000) * 0.3) + \
                         (filtered_df['cuisine_score'] * 0.2)





6.4 Dataset Enhancement

Issue: Missing or inconsistent data (e.g., invalid Latitude/Longitude) affects map display and filtering.
Improvement:
Preprocess the dataset to fill missing values (e.g., geocode missing coordinates using an API).
Standardize cuisine names to reduce mismatches (e.g., "Indian" vs. "North Indian").



6.5 Feedback Analytics

Issue: Feedback is collected but not analyzed systematically.
Improvement:
Store feedback in a CSV file or database to track satisfaction and relevance over time.
Display a dashboard summarizing feedback metrics (e.g., average satisfaction per strategy).
Example:import csv
if feedback_submit:
    with open('feedback.csv', 'a', newline='') as f:
        writer = csv.writer(f)
        writer.writerow([satisfaction, relevance, preferences['strategy'], timestamp])





7. Conclusion
The Restaurant Recommendation System effectively delivers personalized recommendations with A/B testing and re-ranking capabilities. Strategy A (Rating-heavy) outperformed Strategy B (Votes-heavy) in assumed satisfaction and relevance, but both strategies benefit from the re-ranking feature. Proposed improvements, including dynamic re-ranking, enhanced filtering, and feedback analytics, will further enhance usability and accuracy. Collecting actual user feedback and expanding the dataset will strengthen future evaluations.
